<br/>

This app is only a concept test, it's created with a frontend and no server is included. Communication with database is imitated with HTTP Request using Axios, but to a fake database inside the public folder. Server function is imitated by extensive use of Redux. Future vision would include features that allowed DMs to project images and other functions using Socket.io that highten the immersiveness for remote players. Projection of images could include encounter cards and map features. Future map functionality would, for example allow DM to create a fog of war over parts of the map which DM would like to remain hidden from player's view until later story progression.
